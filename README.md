# Godot Box2D
[![ðŸ”— Build Status](https://github.com/godot-box2d/godot-box2d/actions/workflows/runner.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/godot-box2d/godot-box2d/actions/workflows/runner.yml)


A [box2D](https://github.com/erincatto/box2d) physics server for [Godot Engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) 4.1, implemented as a GDExtension.

Currently passes 127/150 of [Godot-Physics-Tests](https://github.com/fabriceci/Godot-Physics-Tests).

## Determinism

Box2D is binary deterministic, but doesn't make any guaratee as for cross platform determinism.
Godot Box2D should also be binary deterministic, however no such tests were run yet.
However, when Box2C gets released, that will be one of this repo's goals to make it cross platform deterministic (from what I spoke to Erin, it should be just the cos and sin functions that are not determinstic).

## Limitations

- Having non symetrical physics mask/layers results in no collision. Eg. if we had the following:

|object|mask|category|
|---|---|---|
|object A|1|2|
|object B|2|2|

       In godot would result a collision, but would be very weird, as only one of the objects would receive collision restution.

- Shape scaling and skewing:
  - Circles and capsules only support uniform scaling and don't support skewing

## Missing/Not implemented

- Body pickable

## Install

### From Godot Asset Store

[Godot Asset Library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2007)

### From Github Releases

1. Download from [Github Releases](https://github.com/godot-box2d/godot-box2d/releases/latest)
2. Extract the ZIP archive and move the `addons/` folder it contains into your project folder
3. Open your project settings
4. Make sure "Advanced Settings" is enabled
5. Go to "Physics" and then "2D"
6. Change "Physics Engine" to "Box2D"
7. Restart Godot

## Building from source

1. Clone the git repository, including its submodules.

2. Open a terminal application and change its working directory to the `godot-box2d` git repository.

3. Compile `godot-cpp` for the desired `target` (`template_debug` or `template_release`):

       cd godot-cpp
       scons target=template_debug generate_bindings=yes

4. Compile the GDExtension for the same `target` as above:

       cd ..
       scons target=template_debug generate_bindings=no

*Note*: The `template_debug` target can also be loaded in the Godot editor.

## Lint

Run `scripts/clang-tidy.sh` in order to lint.
